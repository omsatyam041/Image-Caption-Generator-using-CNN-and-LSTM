# Image-Caption-Generator-using-CNN-and-LSTM
• Built an Image Caption Generator using InceptionV3 and LSTM to generate natural language captions for 8,000 images from the Flickr8k dataset. • Implemented Greedy and Beam Search decoding with BLEU score evaluation, achieving BLEU-1 score of 0.71 and BLEU-4 score of 0.54, integrating Computer Vision and NLP for contextual caption generation.
